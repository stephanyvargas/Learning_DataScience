# Independent study following the book "Deep Learning with Python" from F. Chollet

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the some code samples found in the book [Deep Learning with Python, 2nd Edition (Manning Publications)](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff), plus some personal notes.

This work was done following the study sessions from the [Machine Learning Tokyo group](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/). in this particular case, as of March 2022, we are reading the new edition of the book Deep-Learning-with-Python from F. Chollet.

These notebooks use TensorFlow 2.6.
